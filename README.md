# jsPractice
Repository to track JavaScript practice.

### jsPractice.html
Most basic practice will be done in jsPractice.html with a script tag to easily modify html and JavaScript in the same file.
This file will be overwritten often, relying on the commit history to refer to previous practice.

### exercises
This directory is a fork from The Odin Project JavaScript exercises repository, which I am now realizing may be somewhat outdated. Nonetheless, JavaScript exercises will be completed in this directory.
